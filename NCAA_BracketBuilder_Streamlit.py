## NCAA Bracket Builder
Please place your submission file and other data in the input folder with the names described in './input/info.txt' or
edit the file paths the the necessary data at the tope of the streamlit code.

This GUI will walk you through the bracket game by game. Periodically a table will show you your picks (that you can
eventually export) so that you can make sure things are on track. The slider at the top lets you choose a threshold for
games that you want to manually edit. If you only want to edit close games, choose something like 0.6 or 0.7. If you want
all games to be editable choose 1. If you want to change your selection for a game, click the radio button for the team of
your choice. The result should be reflected in the text below your choice. If not try clicking off and on (and be sure to
check the table before you export your results).

At the end you will have the option to export your final picks and you will be able to see a quick summary of your bracket
that you can screenshot for reference - the bracket is also a good way to check that your selections are okay. Unfortunately,
exporting the bracket requires a standalone installation of Graphvis and isn't an option at this time.

[Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/), the tool used to build this allows you to change the settings to 'wide mode' in the
upper right, which makes the chart more visible. Thanks to Streamlit for building this easy to use tool and all the folks
at Kaggle for putting on the [Google Cloud & NCAAÂ® ML Competition 2020-NCAAM]
(https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-cloud-ncaa-march-madness-2020-division-1-mens-tournament)!
